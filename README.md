Author: Katharina Ledebur, Complexity Science Hub Vienna [ledebur@csh.ac.at](ledebur@csh.ac.at)


A data-driven modelling approach based on an age-structured model that compares 116 Austrian regions to a suitably chosen control set of regions to explain variations in local transmission rates through a combination of meteorological factors, non-pharamaceutical interventions and mobility.
